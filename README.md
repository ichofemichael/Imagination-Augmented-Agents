# Enhancing Intelligent Agents with Imagination
Intelligence necessitates the capacity to strategize for the future, a process often based on prior knowledge. To enable this foresight, I've explored two distinct approaches for augmenting agents with the power of imagination: "Imagination-Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning" and "Querying Fast Generative Models for Reinforcement Learning."

Within the scope of this project, I've successfully developed a Mini-Pacman game employing Reinforcement Learning (RL). The model I've trained demonstrates the ability to navigate the Mini-Pacman environment without user input. The environment itself is generated through the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These mechanisms enable the model to not only retain and recall past experiences but also employ this knowledge to make informed decisions in the future.
